# ZSR-Pubpub-Scraper
Problem: PubPub's impending shutdown requires comprehensive content preservation, but built-in export tools are incomplete and unreliable for capturing the full richness of publications, metadata, and organizational structure.

Goal: Develop a reproducible workflow that exports PubPub content into well-organized, multi-format archives suitable for future migration to other platforms.
